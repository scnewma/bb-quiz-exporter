# Blackboard Quiz Exporter
This is a chrome extension that will parse the DOM on a blackboard quiz and copy it to the clipboard in TSV format.

This TSV format can then be used to import into a flashcard program for easy studying.

## Testing
This has only been tested on the specific version of Blackboard that my class uses.  I don't know if it works on every version (or even every class).

> This is not on the Chrome Web Store, if you want to use it you will have to install it in Chrome yourself.
